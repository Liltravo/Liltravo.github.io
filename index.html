  <h1> BOKU NO HERO ACADEMIA </h1>
<p> Boku no hero is one of my favorite animes so far I like how it has action, drama, and adventure bascially everything I like in a show but just in anime </p>
<p>The main charater is a 15 year old name Izuku Midoriya, who lives in a world were 80% of the population has powers.</p>

<br><p>Deku(a name he was given by his childhood friend who hates him now gave this name to make fun of him) wasn't gifted with a quirk but he still made notes about heores and still believes he can become a hero even without a quirk. </p>
</br>
<p> But this all changed when Deku met his hero the #1 hero All Might first who said he cannot become a hero without a quirk, but after deku risked his life to save his childhood friend/bully Kacchan with his body moving before he had the chance to think gave All Might the courage to go back in his hero form and stop the villian that tried to kill Deku.
  <br>
  <p> This anime has taught me alot about life like how one person can change someone, and to never give up on your dream even if you feel like giving up always try your best have fun and achomblish your goal.
</p>
<p>Deku is a true hero and is trying hard to be All Might's successor.</p>
<p> Additonal information if you Deku is 5'6 he goes to UA he doesn't know how to control his quirk as of yet and his birthday is July 15 which is the day after my Birthday which is July 14 and that is another reason why I like Deku our Birthday's are close to each other but if you want to watch this anime I will leave a link after this paragraph to view this incredible anime.</p>
